The current reality: inverted pyramid of effort

- **Conclusion**: WHO policy briefs, guidelines—outputs that shape nations
- **Limitations**: Time, bias, scale, burnout—constraints that distort evidence
- **Results**: 1 report, 1 officer, 1 deadline missed—the compression of months into moments
- **Methods**: PubMed → Embase → 10,000 abstracts → 3 months—the ritualistic grind
- **Background**: What we know, what we don't—the soil from which everything grows
